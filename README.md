[**RecyBuddies**](https://polar-meadow-21503.herokuapp.com/)
--
This web-app was designed to make recycling more convenient.
It connects someone who wishes to dispose of recyclable materials with someone who makes a living by recycling items.
--
### Some of the technologies that were used:
* Bundler
* Git
* Ruby on Rails
* Ruby
* Heroku - Deployment
* PostgreSQL (Production Environment) & Sqlite3 (Development Environment)
---
### Modeling
* The software is designed for two categories of users: recyclers and those looking to dispose of recyclable things.
* Because both roles are interchangeable, a person can post an item for someone else to pick up while also picking up a recyclable item of their choice.
